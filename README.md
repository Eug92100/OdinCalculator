<h2>newMain.js</h2>
<p>In this version, I used the function eval() which interprets a code statement.
But I wanted to try to create the calculator by myself so I created a main.js version. 
The most difficult part was to make sure that the screen was displaying what I wanted. </h2>

<h2>main.js</h2>
<p> In this version, I also had to create a function that would do the calculations with respect to the prioritisation rules (parenthesis first, then divisions and multiplication and finally from left to right). I also integrated a function that would distinguish the minus operator from the minus sign.
